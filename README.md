## í´ Security Notes

### Network Configuration
- **NEVER commit `settings/Mainnet.toml` or `settings/Testnet.toml`** to version control
- These files contain wallet mnemonics and are excluded via `.gitignore`
- Use the `.example` template files to create your own configurations
- For mainnet deployments, use hardware wallets or secure key management

### Setup Instructions
1. Copy template files:
```bash
   cp settings/Mainnet.toml.example settings/Mainnet.toml
   cp settings/Testnet.toml.example settings/Testnet.toml
```
2. Replace placeholder mnemonics with your own secure mnemonics
3. **Never share or commit these files**

### Devnet Configuration
- `settings/Devnet.toml` uses publicly known test mnemonics (safe to commit)
- Only use for local development - these wallets have no real value
